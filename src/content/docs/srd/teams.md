title: Team play

> While the Heroic Tales rules are written to be read by a solo player, it is also designed to be played with a team. In a team game, characters make decisions collectively.

## Character creation

The process for creating characters in a team game is largely the same as when playing a solo game with one significant exception — before you create individual characters, you’ll collectively create a backstory and reason for your characters to be part of the team.

> In a team game, the characters share any significant starting equipment. For example, the characters in Space Junk are all crew members of a single ship and make decisions on its maintenance and upgrades collectively.

## Challenges

In Heroic Tales, challenges are tackled collectively, and there is no benefit to one player rolling their dice before another. In fact, part of the fun of a team game is describing how your characters interact with each other and the world around you, and *then* rolling your dice at the same time to see how successful your actions were at resolving the challenge.

Heroic Tales scales the difficulty of challenges based on how many characters are part of the team. This allows any number of players to tell similar stories without penalizing small teams and solo play. Use the following chart to determine the `inertia` of the challenges you face as a team.

| **Team Members** | **Easy** | **Normal** | **Hard** | **Tough** | **Arduous** |
| ---------------- | -------- | ---------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| 1                | 2        | 4          | 6        | 8         | 10          |
| 2                | 4        | 8          | 12       | 16        | 20          |
| 3                | 6        | 12         | 18       | 24        | 30          |
| 4                | 8        | 16         | 24       | 32        | 40          |
| 5                | 10       | 20         | 30       | 40        | 50          |
| 6                | 12       | 24         | 36       | 48        | 60          |

In a team game, each member brings two points of `momentum` to a challenge, which is pooled and shared by the team.

## Challenge chains

During a `challenge chain`, the team shares a single `chain die`. Choose one player to track the team's progress.

## Splitting the party

Heroic Tales assumes that team games should be collaborative in nature. While some characters may occasionally want to go one direction while others want to head in another, this is generally a bad idea, both for the fate of the characters and for the flow of play in real life.

Accordingly, the `inertia` of any challenge is based on the number of team members who start a game session, but each group only receives a pool of `momentum` equal to the number of characters present for the challenge.
