*A solo, journaling game about the joy of believing that you're alone in the woods and the terror of finding out that you're not.*

Wendigo is aÂ game about the peace of solitude and the terror of having that peace broken. To play it, you will adopt a persona called a character through whose eyes you will experience this story vicariously.

In the story you create, your character will run for their life through an unforgiving environment while fleeing from an unknown presence. You, the player, will roll dice to determine how well your character navigates the obstacles that confront them. Along the way, you will record their thoughts and fears using as much or as little prose as you'd like. Depending on how the dice fall, your character may live or die; they may emerge with their sanity intact or they may be forever affected by their encounter.
