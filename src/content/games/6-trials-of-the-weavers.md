6 Trials of the Weavers is a solo exploration game where you find yourself transported into the realm of the Weavers, a group of mysterious spider-like creatures. You must complete the six trials they present you with before you have a chance at escaping, encountering plenty of horrifying things along the way.

To play, you will need:

    One standard deck of playing cards, jokers removed
    A handful of six-sided dice
    A journal, blank paper, or notes app. 

**CONTENT NOTE: This game contains heavy references to spiders (including vector images throughout the document), insects, body horror, and general horror themes.**
